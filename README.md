# Theme Park Analytics By Ayema Qureshi

## Business Problem 
- Supernova Theme Park is preparing its strategy for the upcoming quarter and needs data-driven insights to guide decision-making. Leadership is looking for a unified view across operations, marketing, and guest behavior to ensure resources are allocated efficiently while still maximizing revenue. The challenge is to balance staffing needs, guest satisfaction, and ticket/package optimization in a way that keeps visitors returning and spending more.

## Stakeholders 
**Primary Stakeholder: Park General Manager (GM)** 
- Oversees the entire theme park’s performance and relies on cross-departmental insights to set strategy for revenue growth and guest satisfaction.

**Supporting Stakeholder: Operations Director**
- Focuses on staffing levels, queue management, and daily efficiency. They need accurate demand forecasts (busy days, peak hours) to allocate staff effectively.

**Supporting Stakeholder: Marketing Director**
- Designs promotions and ticket/package mixes. They use insights on guest behavior, repeat spending, and switching patterns to refine pricing and campaigns.


## Overview of Database & Schema (short star-schema note) 
- The database is organized as a star schema, a common design in analytics where a central fact table contains quantitative measures (e.g., spend, visits, wait times) and is surrounded by dimension tables that add descriptive context (e.g., guest demographics, ticket type, attraction details). Facts and dimensions are linked by keys, creating a simple, intuitive “star” layout. This structure makes it easier to run flexible queries—such as analyzing revenue by ticket type, evaluating satisfaction by ride category, or tracking attendance over time—while keeping performance efficient.

### Fact Tables
- `fact_visits`: Records each guest’s visit, including date, group size, and total spend.
- `fact_purchases`: Tracks in-park purchases like food, drinks, and merchandise.
- `fact_ride_events`: Captures ride experiences such as wait times and satisfaction ratings.

### Dimension Tables
- `dim_guest`: Guest information such as home state and demographics.
- `dim_ticket`: Ticket details including type, pricing, and restrictions.
- `dim_date`: Calendar context like day of week, weekend flag, and season.
- `dim_attraction`: Attraction details including ride name, category, and height limits.


## EDA (SQL)
During the EDA phase, I used SQL to validate the dataset and uncover initial patterns that would shape later analysis. Rather than diving straight into modeling, I first checked for coverage, quality, and baseline trends.
- You can view the full queries here: [01_EDA.sql](SQL/01_EDA.sql)

**Time Coverage & Visit Volume**
- Pulled the min/max visit dates and daily counts using `MIN(visit_date)`, `MAX(visit_date)`, and `COUNT(DISTINCT visit_date)`.
- Why: to check the range of data available and identify busy/slow periods for operations.

**Ticket & Guest Behavior**
- Counted visits by ticket type with `GROUP BY ticket_type_name` after joining `fact_visits` to `dim_ticket`.
- Why: to see which ticket products drive attendance and inform marketing strategy.

**Data Quality Checks (Nulls & Duplicates)**
- Ran a null audit `(SUM(CASE WHEN col IS NULL THEN 1 END))` and checked for duplicates in `fact_ride_events`.
- Why: to confirm which fields are reliable. For example, ~50% of `wait_minutes` are missing and ~21% of `total_spend_cents` are NULL, so they require special handling later.

Overall, the EDA confirmed broad date coverage for visits, revealed which ticket types dominate attendance, and highlighted key data quality issues (nulls and duplicates) to address before deeper analysis. These findings set the foundation for cleaning, feature engineering, and business-focused queries in the next steps.


## CTEs & Window Functions (SQL)
Below are the key CTE + window patterns I used, with tight snippets and why they matter for staffing and improvements. Four main analyses:
- You can view the full queries here: [04_ctes_windows.sql](SQL/04_ctes_windows.sql) 

1. Daily performance (Ops staffing)
   - Used running totals with `SUM(...) OVER (ORDER BY date_iso`) and `daily ranks with DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY daily_visits DESC)`.
    - **Use**: Identify top-3 busiest days for staff scheduling and track momentum for the GM. For Operations, knowing the peak days means scheduling staff more effectively — ensuring enough ride operators, food staff, and guest services on high-traffic days like July 7th. For the GM, the running totals provide visibility into overall park momentum, answering questions like “Are we on track to beat last week’s numbers?” or “Which days consistently carry attendance?


2. RFM & CLV by state (guest targeting)
   - Found each guest’s last visit with `MAX(visit_date) OVER (PARTITION BY guest_id)` and ranked spend within state using `RANK() OVER (...)`.
   - **Use**: This ranking shows who the top spenders are in each state. For Marketing, rank-1 guests represent the most valuable individuals in their region — the ideal targets for loyalty programs, exclusive offers, or early access promotions. For the GM, the breakdown reveals which states send the highest-value visitors overall, guiding decisions about regional partnerships and advertising spend. Lower-rank guests can also be nurtured with targeted campaigns to encourage them to “climb the ladder.

3. Behavior change (repeat visit spending)
   - Compared visits with `LAG(spend_cents_clean) OVER (PARTITION BY guest_id)` to calculate `delta_spend`.
   - **Use**: Found that 43% of repeat visits spent more than their previous visit. This means nearly half of returning guests are open to increasing their spending — a strong signal for Marketing to target them with bundles, upsells, or loyalty perks. For Operations, this insight highlights when to staff food, retail, and guest services more heavily, since repeat visitors are more likely to purchase extras..

4. Ticket switching (pricing & packaging)
   - Captured each guest’s first ticket with` FIRST_VALUE(ticket_type_name)` and flagged switches using `CASE WHEN current_ticket <> first_ticket`.
   - **Use**: Every repeat guest switched tickets at least once. This shows the tiers are flexible and attractive, but also suggests guests may not pick the right option upfront — an opportunity to improve how tickets are packaged and explained

Together, these CTE and window function analyses connected guest behavior to concrete business actions: staffing the right days, targeting the most valuable guests, understanding spending growth on return visits, and evaluating ticket product fit. By layering queries step by step, the park can turn raw data into decisions that directly improve both guest satisfaction and revenue.


## Visuals (Python)
**Daily Performance**

- This bar chart shows daily attendance across the observed period, with the busiest day highlighted in blue. Identifying peak days helps the Operations Director adjust staffing schedules to match demand, ensuring shorter queues and smoother guest flow. In this case, July 7th stands out as the busiest day of the week, making it worth exploring what factors—such as promotions, holidays, or special events—may have contributed to the spike.

**Which Guests are most valuable**

<img width="600" height="400" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-22 at 5 41 59 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4eb7c33f-fcdb-4b3e-8a08-709d6c0c4aa1" />

- This bar chart highlights total lifetime spend by guest home state, with California standing out as the top contributor in purple. Understanding geographic spending patterns helps the Marketing Director prioritize outreach, tailoring promotions to high-value states like CA while identifying opportunities to grow spend in lower-performing regions such as TX and FL. These insights can inform both regional advertising and park-specific offerings.

**Behavioral Change by Ticket Type**

<img width="600" height="400" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-22 at 5 42 53 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/844d3a0f-e270-43ca-ac78-d01f7a424d51" />

- This bar chart shows how different ticket types influence spending behavior on repeat visits. Guests with Day Passes (highlighted in red) were most likely to increase their spending compared to prior visits, while VIP and Family Pack holders showed lower increases. For the Marketing Director, this suggests that day-pass guests may be the most responsive to upsells or in-park promotions, whereas bundled ticket holders may already be maximizing value upfront.


## Insights & Recommendations — actions for GM/Ops/Marketing 

**For the General Manager (GM)**
- Overall guest behavior shows satisfaction with pricing tiers. The fact that guests tended to upgrade tickets (rather than downgrade) suggests the park’s pricing structure is competitive and flexible. This is a strong signal that the value proposition is resonating with visitors.
- **Action**: Continue monitoring ticket switching trends. Upgrades can be leveraged as a performance metric for guest satisfaction and pricing effectiveness.


**For Operations (Staffing & Queues)**
- Daily attendance spikes (like the clear peak on July 7th) highlight when additional staffing is needed for rides, food & beverage, and guest services.
- **Action**: Proactively schedule more staff on projected peak days (especially Mondays following weekends) to shorten queues and improve flow.


**For Marketing (Promotions & Ticket Mix)**
- Geographic insights show CA and NY guests generate the highest lifetime value (CLV). This indicates strong markets for targeted promotions.
   - **Action**: Focus marketing campaigns (email, social media, travel partnerships) on high-value states, while testing strategies to boost engagement from underperforming regions like TX and FL.
- Ticket type analysis revealed that Day Pass holders are most likely to increase spending on repeat visits.
   - **Action**: Prioritize upsell strategies for Day Pass guests — such as bundling dining credits, photo packages, or early ride access — to maximize per-guest revenue.


**Cross-Department Recommendation**
- Upgrade behavior shows that the current ticket tiers are well-calibrated: guests see enough value to move into higher tiers such as VIP or Family Pack. This signals that pricing and product flexibility are a strength worth maintaining. However, operational metrics like wait times and satisfaction ratings suggest that the guest experience does not always match the higher spend. To sustain upgrade momentum, the park should pair its strong pricing structure with improvements in ride throughput and service quality, ensuring that guests feel their premium purchases deliver a premium experience.


_Summary:_
- The park’s ticket pricing tiers appear effective, as most guests upgraded rather than downgraded. Operationally, staffing can be optimized by anticipating peak days, while Marketing can double down on high-value states and focus upsells on flexible Day Pass guests. Together, these actions align with leadership’s goal of maximizing revenue while keeping guest satisfaction high.

## Ethics & Bias — data gaps, cleaning choices, duplicates, time window, margin not modeled 

Like any real-world dataset, this project involved gaps and quirks that shaped the analysis:

- _Missing data and duplicates_: Several tables had nulls and exact duplicate rows. Rather than permanently deleting records in SQL, I created views to work from, which allowed me to filter and clean without losing the raw source data. This kept the process transparent and reversible.
- _Logical inconsistencies_: Some patterns did not align intuitively, such as guests with longer wait times reporting higher satisfaction. While this may reflect quirks in survey response behavior, it also shows the limits of the dataset. These anomalies remind us not to over-interpret single metrics without context.
- _Data coverage_: The dataset reflects only a specific time window of park operations. This means conclusions about seasonality or long-term guest behavior should be viewed with caution.
- _Unmodeled factors_: Margins and profitability were not included in this dataset. For example, two ticket types may generate the same revenue but very different costs. That’s an important blind spot when making pricing or staffing recommendations.

By documenting cleaning choices, acknowledging gaps, and noting where the data may not reflect reality, I aimed to keep this analysis transparent. Any real business decision should validate these findings with additional data (e.g., staff logs, survey design checks, cost data) before implementation.

## Expanded Analysis (Individual Contribution)

This section describes the additional work I completed after the group project was finished. My goal with this expansion was to move beyond basic aggregations and create a more accurate and meaningful understanding of guest behavior and value using SQL.

### Improvements I Implemented

- Added a new metric to calculate **spend per person** instead of only total spend  
- Improved the repeat guest feature by creating **guest segments based on visit frequency** (one-time, occasional, frequent)  
- Combined segmentation with spending behavior to analyze how guest frequency relates to individual value  

---

### Detailed Implementation

#### 1. Spend Per Person Metric

In the original project, spending was primarily analyzed using total spend per visit. However, this does not account for differences in group size, which can distort how we interpret guest value.

To address this, I created a new metric:
- Calculated as: `spend_cents_clean / party_size`
- Used `NULLIF(party_size, 0)` to avoid division errors
- Converted values from cents to dollars for readability

This allowed me to standardize spending at the **individual level**, making comparisons across visits more meaningful.

---

#### 2. Guest Segmentation (Feature Improvement)

The original project used a basic repeat guest flag, which only distinguished between repeat and non-repeat visitors.

I improved this by:
- Counting total visits per `guest_id`
- Creating a segmentation using a CASE statement:
  - `one_time` → 1 visit  
  - `occasional` → 2–3 visits  
  - `frequent` → 4+ visits  

This approach captures **different levels of engagement**, rather than treating all repeat guests the same.

---

#### 3. Connecting Segmentation to Spending Behavior

After creating the guest segments, I joined them back to the `fact_visits` table and calculated:

- Average spend per person per segment  

This allowed me to directly compare how guest frequency relates to individual spending behavior.

---

### Why These Changes Matter

The original analysis provided a strong overview of park activity, but it had two main limitations:

1. **Total spend alone can be misleading**  
   Larger groups naturally generate higher total spend, which does not necessarily reflect higher individual value. By introducing spend per person, I was able to normalize this and make fair comparisons across different types of visits.

2. **Repeat vs non-repeat is too broad**  
   Not all repeat guests behave the same. Someone who visits twice is very different from someone who visits five or more times. By segmenting guests based on visit frequency, the analysis becomes more nuanced and actionable.

Overall, these changes improve how well the analysis reflects **true customer value and behavior**, which is more useful for both marketing and operational decisions.

---

### Example New Insight

From this expanded analysis, I found that **occasional guests spend more per person than frequent guests**, with occasional guests averaging around $99.79 per person and frequent guests averaging around $86.83.

This suggests that while frequent guests visit more often, they may spend less per visit on an individual basis. In contrast, occasional guests may treat visits as higher-value experiences, leading to higher per-person spending.

It’s important to note that this dataset is synthetic, so these patterns may not fully reflect real-world behavior. However, the analysis demonstrates how adding better metrics and segmentation can reveal insights that would not be visible from total spend alone.
